# The-Mosh-Site-Vidly

Orignially based upon Mosh's Vidly site. Worked as a perfect tutorial in combination with my last project which is also based on movies 
in a database.

I'm kind of at a loss on where to go with this site as it was just for practice it really lacked an overall end game goal which is always really bad. productivity starts slipping and I am well aware of that. I seem to turn this readme files into more blogs than documentation as who really looks at all this code? 

I have learned quite a bit about MVC by doing this and even how to better my winforms class seperation and orginazation. 

There is still a bit to add to this to really make it pop both in css work and functionally. I'm trying to keep up with this readme but I get stuck on coding and not writing ;P
